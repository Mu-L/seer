This test shows how to debug a program by launching
the program using gdbserver and having Seer attach to
the gdbserver.

In one window, launch the program using gdbserver.

    $ gdbserver :1234 hellogdbserver

In another window, lauch Seer.

    $ seergdb --project project.seer

The project file has the info that Seer needs.

    - Program name
    - Debug filename
    - gdbserver port


To exit propery, enter this command in Seer's gdb input field.

    monitor exit

It tells the gdbserver to shutdown. If you don't, the gdbsver
process will need to be kill with "kill -9".
